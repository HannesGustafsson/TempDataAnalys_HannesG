# TempDataAnalys_HannesG

This is a program that takes in and analyzes 300 000+ data points, over the span of a year, logging temperature, air humidity and dates.
Values are measured both indoors as well as outdoors and stored in a .txt file.
The values are sorted to the users choosing using mergesort for increased performance.
